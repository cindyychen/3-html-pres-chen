As I sketched out the birds, 
A small breeze brushed my back,
the sun began to disappear over the horizon,
Leaving me in a blanket of darkness 
with chirping crickets and flashing fireflies.
The smell of pine needles filled my nose
As the stars glisten through the twilight sky,
And all I could hear was the howling of the wind
In harmony with the buzz of crickets.
